    "A trader could use the following steps to exploit the arbitrage opportunity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signal Identification:** Continuously monitor the arbitrage spread using updated TIPS, inflation swap, and Treasury data. A consistently positive spread signals an opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Position Construction:**\n",
    "   - **Long Position:** Purchase TIPS and enter into corresponding zero-coupon inflation swap contracts to convert the real cash flows into fixed nominal cash flows.\n",
    "   - **Short Position:** Short the nominal Treasury bond (or use Treasury futures/repurchase agreements as a proxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cash Flow Matching:** Utilize Treasury STRIPS or additional derivatives to ensure that the cash flows from the long and short positions align, thereby locking in the arbitrage profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Risk Management:** Monitor execution costs, margin requirements, and liquidity risks. Funding constraints and counterparty risks must also be managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy, while theoretically risk-free, requires meticulous execution and risk management in practice."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis confirms that a positive TIPS-Treasury arbitrage spread persisted throughout 2010–2020. Although the magnitude of the mispricing is lower than during the earlier period covered by Fleckenstein et al. (2014), the spread remains statistically and economically significant. This persistence underscores the impact of market frictions and funding constraints on arbitrage opportunities. In practice, traders could exploit this anomaly by constructing synthetic nominal positions using TIPS, inflation swaps, and nominal Treasury bonds, while carefully managing execution and funding risks."
